# 👹 [Halloween.dev](https://www.halloween.dev/) Challenges

Welcome to my collection of coding challenges 🎃  
Here I share my solutions to various problems involving logic, algorithms, and data manipulation.  
Each challenge is organized by number and includes:

- The final implementation in **TypeScript / JavaScript**
- A dedicated test file (`.test.ts`) with the test cases used for validation

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

- **Node.js** v20 or higher
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

# 🧪 Running Tests

Run all tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
Example output:
```bash
halloweendev git:(develop) ✗ npm test

> halloweendev@1.0.0 test
> vitest
