# [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) Challenges

Welcome to my collection of coding challenges   
Here I share my solutions to various problems involving logic, algorithms, and data manipulation.  
Each challenge is organized by number and includes:

- The final implementation in **JavaScript**
- A dedicated test file (`.test.js`) with the test cases used for validation

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

- **Node.js** v20 or higher
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

# 🧪 Running Tests

Run all tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
Example output:
```bash
